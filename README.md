# Checkers AR

Checkers AR is an augmented reality iOS application. The application will use the device camera in order to track game pieces on the checkerboard. We will use this tracking information to place digital images and coloring overlaid on the pieces and game board. The images/coloring will follow pieces as they are moved to a new location on the board throughout gameplay.
